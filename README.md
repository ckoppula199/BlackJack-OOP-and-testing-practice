# BlackJack-OOP-and-testing-practice
In this project I will mainly be focussing on creating obect oriented code in python along with carrying out test driven development. I will also use a decorator to help with logging the results of the tests. As the main focus is on OOP, testing and logging I chose to create a blackjack game as it is simple enough not to distract me from my main focus
